# Developement log

0. **Work distribution**

1. **Week 3** The datasets are downloaded, the code for reading the files is written. A constructor that use the readFile functions that read the datas into different integer vectors is made. Two functions (incidentEdges and areAdjecent) are completed but not tested. Begin developing the traversal function. Start trying to format the graph structure toward adjacency list.
2. **Week 4** Added functions and classes to implement adjacency list, needs testing but should only need small tweaks to get to work. Going to start to attempt to build adjacency list from data set.
