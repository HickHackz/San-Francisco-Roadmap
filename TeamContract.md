# Team Contract

## Communication:
    1.Team Meeting: We will attempt to meet once per week for a period of one hour via zoom to discuss progress on the project. The meeting will be recorded if members could not make it to the meeting or wish to review what was discussed. A person will also be the note taker responsible for taking note and drafting developement log of the week, rotatte between members each week.

    2.Assistance: We will create a discord group between our member and our mentor to contact each other. We will also share our email adress with each other, so an alternative mean to reach someone is avilible when discord cannot reach them.

    3.Respect: The note taker of the week will be responsible for moderating the weekly meeting, so that our discussion remain civiled. They should also ensure that each member get their chance to speak their mind and ask their questions during a meeting. Disagreement between members will be settled via voting with majority rule. If a majority cannot be reached between the four group members, the mentor will be consulted in order to resolve the conflict. By signing this document, each member agree to the proposed method of conflict resolution.

## Collaboration:
    1.Work DisTribution: During each weekly meeting, members will discuss what parts of the project to be focused on for the week and which member is responsible for for them. Member volunteering for the part of the project is perferred, but if no one volunteer, we will determind a two person team to work on the program for the week. No single person should work on the project for over two week in a roll in order to ensure an evenly distributed work load.

    2.Time Commitment: To ensure even work distribution, each member assigned with parts of the project for the week should spend two to five hours per week on the project. Other group members should try to be avilible to assist them with unforseen difficulties. If a member was unable to reach their required commitment repeatedly, the group will communicate with the member to discuss their circumstance and what accommodation can be made to help the member.

    3.Conflict resolution: If disagreement arise between members, they will first commuciate with each other in attempt to reach an agreement. If an agreement could not be reached, a vote will be held either via discord or weekly meeting. If the vote yield no majority, the team will contact the mentor for final conflict resolution.
